## AI Tool Used

- Initial template was generated using an **AI website-building tool**  
  (replace this line with the actual tool name, e.g. `Bolt.new` or `Lovable.dev`).

## Manual Changes I Made

After generating the base template using the AI tool, I manually:

1. Cleaned up the HTML structure and class names.
2. Re-wrote the CSS using a **mobile-first** approach.
3. Added responsive **media queries** for:
   - mobile
   - tablet
   - desktop
4. Implemented a **CSS-only hamburger menu** for mobile.
5. Created a **skills grid** layout that changes columns at different breakpoints.
6. Added **subtle animations** and **hover effects** for buttons and cards.
7. Ensured the page has **no horizontal scrolling** on mobile.
